      <h2>Smart Cookie Rewards Platform</h2>
      <h3>What is Smart Cookie?</h3>
      <p>
        Smart Cookie is a teacher-student reward program designed to foster a
        fun, interactive, and rewarding environment for both teachers and
        students. The program allows teachers to recognize and reward students
        for their achievements in various activities, such as sports, drawing,
        class tests, and more. This initiative aims to make the educational
        process more engaging and motivating by providing real-time rewards that
        acknowledge students' efforts and accomplishments. By doing so, it
        encourages students to strive for excellence and feel appreciated,
        leading to increased motivation and a more competitive environment. This
        platform can be extended to Player-Coach Rewards and Employee-Manager
        Rewards.
      </p>

      <h3>Instant Appreciation, Recognition, and Rewards</h3>
      <p>
        It is often noticed that students' outstanding performances go
        unacknowledged, and the dedicated teachers who shape their careers from
        the start are rarely recognized for their efforts. If we fail to
        appreciate those who deserve it, they may stop doing the things we
        value. Our program addresses this issue by providing a platform where
        students and teachers can receive timely recognition for their
        achievements. As we know, rewards are crucial in promoting good work and
        bringing out the best in individuals. In this context, our program
        offers points as a token of appreciation from teachers to students for
        their accomplishments in various areas, such as academics, sports, arts,
        and community service. Similarly, students can thank their teachers for
        their dedication, guidance, mentorship, humor, and cooperation.
      </p>

      <h3>Point Distribution and Reward Flow</h3>
      <p>The point distribution process in Smart Cookie operates as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookie Admin:</strong> Distributes points to the Group Admin,
          representing an organization comprising multiple colleges or schools.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Group Admin:</strong> Distributes these points to the School
          Admin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>School Admin:</strong> Distributes Green Points (Reward
          Points) to teachers and Blue Points (Thank You Points) to students for
          further distribution. They also maintain detailed information about
          the school, including teacher and student counts, non-teaching staff,
          parents, subjects, students per semester, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Upload:</strong> The school admin uploads an Excel file
          containing all school data to the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Point Request:</strong> If a Smart Cookie member lacks
          sufficient points to generate a coupon, they can request the necessary
          points from a friend.
        </li>
